# What's New With 2.1.0

* Change `populate()` in `ActiveEntity` so the target is the last argument so you can just pass a struct as the first argument [\#29](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cborm/issues/29)
* Make the `save()` operation return the saved entity or array of entities instead of the Base ORM service to allow for concatenated fluent design [\#28](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cborm/issues/28)
